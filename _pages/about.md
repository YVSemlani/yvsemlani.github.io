I'm a first year undergraduate in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at UNC Chapel Hill doing research under Dr. Gedas Bertasius. I'm interested in efficient approaches to long-context sequence modeling, particularly state-space models, and their applications to long-video understanding. Currently, I'm learning about GPU programming with the goal of developing a kernel for efficient training of Test Time Training layers.

When I'm not researching you will almost certainly find me playing poker! I'm the president and founder of [UNC Pokerbots](https://uncpokerbots.com) a hackathon-style competition where students build automated pokerbots to play heads-up poker, a member of the Carolina Poker Club's Intercollegiate Poker Association competition team, and an avid cash poker player.
