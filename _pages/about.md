I’m a fifth-year Computer Science PhD student at Stanford, advised by Prof. Chris Re and affiliated with the Stanford AI Lab, Statistical Machine Learning Group and Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM).

I’m interested in sequence modeling techniques for building large-scale foundation models, as well as problems that arise due to the deployment of ML models to practice. These days I’m also thinking about how the application of FMs will change computing interfaces in the coming decades, especially in fields that require deep, exploratory work like data science.
